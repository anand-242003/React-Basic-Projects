# � Project 1: Skincare Static Page  
*A basic HTML/CSS page built with React + Vite to practice fundamentals.*  
## 🎯 What I Learned  
- How to structure JSX (HTML-like syntax in React).  
- Basic CSS styling without frameworks.  
- Using Vite’s asset handling (images, CSS files).  

## 🚀 How to Run  
## bash
cd project-1
npm install
npm run dev
## 📝 Notes
This is a static, desktop-only page (no responsiveness yet).

Focused purely on React+HTML/CSS setup (no interactivity).
